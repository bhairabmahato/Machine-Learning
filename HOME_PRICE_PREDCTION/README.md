# Home Prices Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict home prices based on the area. The model is trained using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression`, and the trained model is saved and loaded using both `pickle` and `joblib`.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- pickle (part of the Python standard library)
- joblib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home-prices-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd home-prices-prediction
    ```

3. Ensure the CSV file `homeprices.csv` is in the project directory.

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python predict_home_prices.py
    ```
### Steps:

1. **Data Loading**: The CSV file `homeprices.csv` is read into a DataFrame.
2. **Model Training**: A linear regression model is trained using the 'area' column as the feature and 'price' as the target.
3. **Model Parameters**: The model's coefficient and intercept are printed.
4. **Prediction**: The model predicts the price for a house with an area of 5600 sq ft.
5. **Model Saving and Loading with Pickle**: The trained model is saved and loaded using the `pickle` module, and predictions are made.
6. **Model Saving and Loading with Joblib**: The trained model is saved and loaded using the `joblib` module, and predictions are made.
