## Introduction

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors affecting employee retention and to build a logistic regression model to predict employee retention.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/giripujar/hr-analytics).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze which variables have a direct and clear impact on employee retention.
   - Plot bar charts showing the impact of employee salaries on retention.
   - Plot bar charts showing the correlation between department and employee retention.


## Data Preparation

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Create dummy variables for categorical data (salary).
   - Prepare the final dataset for model training.

## Model Building

1. **Building Logistic Regression Model**:
   - Split the data into training and test sets.
   - Train a logistic regression model.
   - Evaluate the model.


## Results

The logistic regression model is evaluated based on its accuracy on the test set. The model's accuracy is printed after training and predicting.
