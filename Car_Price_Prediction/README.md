# Car Prices Prediction

This project demonstrates a linear regression model to predict car selling prices based on mileage and age. The model is trained using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression`, and the performance is evaluated using train-test split.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-prices-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd car-prices-prediction
    ```

3. Ensure the CSV file `carprices.csv` is in the project directory.

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python predict_car_prices.py
    ```
### Steps:

1. **Data Loading**: The CSV file `carprices.csv` is read into a DataFrame.
2. **Data Visualization**: Scatter plots of mileage vs. sell price and age vs. sell price are displayed.
3. **Feature Selection**: 'Mileage' and 'Age(yrs)' are chosen as features, and 'Sell Price($)' is the target variable.
4. **Data Splitting**: The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
5. **Model Training**: A linear regression model is trained using the training data.
6. **Model Prediction**: Predictions are made on the test data, and the model's accuracy is printed.
7. **Example Predictions**: Example test cases are predicted and displayed.
