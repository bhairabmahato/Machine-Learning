## Installation

To set up the environment for these projects, you need to have Python installed along with the required packages. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machinelearning.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd machinelearning
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each project has its own set of instructions in its directory. Refer to the respective README files for detailed instructions on running the projects. Here's a general guide:

1. Navigate to the project's directory:

    ```bash
    cd project_directory
    ```

2. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main_script.py
    ```

*(Replace `project_directory` and `main_script.py` with the actual directory and script names)*
